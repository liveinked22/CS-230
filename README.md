* Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room needed a cross-platform web version of their Android-only game "Draw It or Lose It." The work involved ensuring there are always different games, teams, and players with patterns such as Singleton and Iterator. An API had to be extended for the web, requiring server-client architecture and validation of all IDs.

* What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
When writing the software design document, I did well at writing out the domain model and communicating what each component does (Singleton to create a service instance and iterators for the game, team, and player IDs). This depth ensured I delivered a quality design that matched the client’s requirements for differentiation and scale.

* What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
This design document was important because the process had an overall strategy that would be incorporated into the coding process to prevent confusion and have a single development flow. It helped to keep everything structured and to target what resources made the most sense for this application, based on the client’s needs. 

* If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I revised my work, I would reevaluate and update the table with more information, weighing better options for developing the application. While Linux was my final selection as the operating system recommendation, Windows is a prime candidate for a theoretical instance of the design document. Researching different development tools within the Windows environment may unveil something useful and efficient enough to change the whole design route.

* How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The final product needs to meet the users’ expectations, and all users expect speed and efficiency. Other than the users’ addressed needs, they also need security implementations for their data. The user is the driver of the application, and if their needs aren’t met, they aren’t using the application.

* How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My process for designing the software was structured, from an overview to the individual refinement of each component. In the future, I would choose Windows because of its user base, support, and wide use in many development environments. Windows has a nice interface, great security, and large app support, so it’s a good option for creating and distributing games.
